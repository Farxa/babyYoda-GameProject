Recommended layer order (01_Sky being behind of everything and 12_Desert being in front):

01_Sky
02_Stars
03_Moon
04_Cloud
05_Cloud
06_Cloud
07_Cloud
08_Cloud
09_Cloudsmall
10_Cloudsmall
11_Mountains
12_Desert

It's recommended that you will lower the opacity of the Cloud-assets (Something between 80% and 100% is optimal).

You can use only the Combined Background-image as a background if you want to, it is seamless but you can't get the Parallax-effect with it.


Thank you for choosing this background!
